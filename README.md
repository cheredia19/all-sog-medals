## Athens 1896

The **Olympic Games of Athens 1896**, considered the first ones of the Contemporary Age, were held in Athens, Greece, between April 6 and 15, 1896. Two hundred and forty-one male athletes from 14 countries competed (there was no female participation) in nine sports.

The most successful competitor was the German wrestler and gymnast [Carl Schuhmann](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/carl-schumann), who won four gold medals, two of them individually.

Since then, athletes from all over the world meet every four years to compete against each other. Due to the First and Second World Wars, no games were held in 1916, 1940, 1944, and 1948.

## Paris 1900

The **Paris 1900 Olympic Games** took place from May 14 to October 28, 1900, within the framework of the Universal Exposition. 

As a consequence, there was no opening or closing ceremony, the events took place over five months, and these events were not called "Olympic Games" in official documents or on promotional posters, so many athletes would be unaware, some until their deaths, that they had competed in the Olympic Games.

According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), 997 athletes from 24 countries, **including 22 women**, competed. [Charlotte Cooper](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/charlotte-cooper), a British tennis player, was the first female Olympic champion in an individual competition. 

With his victories in the 60-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, 200-meter hurdles, and long jump, the American athlete [Alvin Kraenzlein](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/alvin-kraenzlein) was the main winner of the event.

After Tokyo 2020, Kraenzlein remains the only athlete to have won **four individual track and field gold medals at the same Olympic Games**. 

The hosts dominated the medal tally with 101 medals (26 gold) ahead of the United States (47, 19) and Great Britain (30, 15).

## St. Louis 1904

The **1904 St. Louis Olympic Games** were held between July 1 and November 23, 1904. Six hundred and fifty-one athletes (only six women) from 12 countries participated, competing in 16 Olympic sports.

These games were part of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. The organizers spread the sporting events over more than four months, just like in the previous edition.

Only 42 athletes from other countries participated because the organizers barely managed to interest athletes from Europe in crossing the Atlantic to participate in the event, allowing the United States to almost exclusively dominate the medal table.

For the first time, Olympic sports included freestyle wrestling and boxing.

## London 1908

The **London 1908 Olympic Games** took place from April 27 to October 31, 1908. With a total duration of **187 days**, these were the longest in the history of the modern Olympic Games.

2,008 athletes (1,971 men and 37 women) from 22 countries participated, competing in 24 sports and 105 events.

Competitors from 19 countries earned medals, with Great Britain leading the medal table, followed by the United States and Sweden.

The **1912 Stockholm Olympic Games** were held between May 5 and July 27, 1912. It was attended by 2,407 athletes (2,359 men and 48 women) from 28 countries.

This edition was the first to feature events such as **decathlon** and **pentathlon**, both won by the American athlete [Jim Thorpe](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/jim-thorpe), **women's diving**, and **women's swimming**.

The medals were mostly shared between the Swedish and U.S. delegations, with the former prevailing in the overall medal count with 65 total medals, while the latter was the most successful in gold medals, with 25.

## Antwerp 1920

After not celebrating the Olympics in 1916 due to World War I, the sixth edition of the modern Olympics finally took place from April 20 to September 12, 1920, in Antwerp, Belgium.

Despite the great Central Empires (German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria) not being invited to the Games, participation reached a then-record high of 29 countries and 2,626 athletes. 

Twenty-two disciplines were competed in, with 152 events. Brazil, Estonia, Monaco, New Zealand, and former countries Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia made their debut at the Olympic Games.

As in the 1912 Stockholm Games, the countries that won the most medals were the United States, Sweden, and Great Britain. But Belgium was third overall thanks to its 16 gold medals.

American shooter [Willis Lee](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/willis-lee) was the most successful athlete with seven medals, five of them gold, while Italian fencer [Nedo Nadi](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/nedo-nadi) won all five events in which he performed.

The Olympic program of this edition comprised 22 sports disciplines, with 123 events.

Austrian-American swimmer [Johnny Weissmüller](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/johnny-weissmuller), famous for his role as Tarzan, won four medals (three gold and a bronze) in swimming and water polo. Finnish [Paavo Nurmi](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/paavo-nurmi) won the 1500m and 5000m races, held within an hour of each other, and the cross-country, held in extremely high temperatures.

## Amsterdam 1928

The **Amsterdam 1928 Olympic Games** were held between May 17 and August 12 of that year. A total of 2,883 athletes (2,606 men and 277 women) from 46 countries participated, competing in 19 disciplines and 104 specialties.

Finland's **Paavo Nurmi** won three more gold medals in the long-distance and middle-distance events to finish his brilliant career with nine gold medals. For his part, **Johnny Weissmüller** once again won the 100-meter sprint freestyle swimming event and finished with five gold medals in swimming and a bronze in water polo.

Athletes from 28 nations won a gold medal, a record that was not broken until 40 years later.

## Los Angeles 1932

The Olympic Games returned to the United States after remaining in Europe for 28 years, but the trip to the far west coast and the fact that the [Great Depression](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression) was still plaguing the world, led to a reduction in the number of participating countries and athletes, especially from Europe.

Thus, the number of nations participating dropped from 46 to 37. Consequently, the number of athletes dropped 55.9%, from 3,014 to 1,328 (1,206 men and 126 women).

Japanese 14 years and 309 days old swimmer [Kusuo Kitamura](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/kusuo-kitamura) won in the 1500 m freestyle swimming and became the youngest athlete to win a gold medal. Kitamura kept the record for 58 years, until Hungarian swimmer Krisztina Egerszegi broke it.

American [Mildred Didrikson](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/mildred-didrikson), considered by many authorities *the greatest all-round sportswoman in history*, won the gold medal in the javelin and set world records in the high jump and 80 meters.

## Berlin 1936

The **1936 Berlin Olympic Games** took place during the period of the Third Reich, from August 1-16.  Three thousand and 632 men and 331 women from 49 countries competed in 24 sports and 119 events. 

The most outstanding athlete was the unforgettable [Jesse Owens](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/jesse-owens). The African-American won four gold medals, a blow to the so-called white supremacy proclaimed by the Nazis.

An off-the-sports issue occurred when athlete Gretel Bergmann was excluded from the German team because she was Jewish. Bergmann set a national record in the high jump event a month before the games.

## Helsinki 1952

Helsinki 1952, the first Olympics after World War II, was held between July 19 and August 3, 1952, when 4,436 men and 519 women from 69 countries gathered in the Finnish capital.

Helsinki was supposed to host the 1940 Summer Olympic Games, replacing Tokyo. However, the event couldn't take place due to the development of the war. Years later, Helsinki bid again and was chosen as the 1952 Olympic host by the IOC in 1947.

Until Beijing 2008, the Helsinki Olympic Games were the edition with the most records (world and olympic) broken. This edition saw the **debut of the Soviet Union and Israel**, and the **return of Japan and Germany**.

The country that won the most medals was the United States, with 76 medals. The Czechoslovak athlete [Emil Zátopek](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/emil-zatopek) won the gold medal in the 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters, and the marathon. 

Helsinki marked the first medal ever for Venezuela. Athlete [Asnoldo Devonish](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/arnoldo-devonish) won the Bronze medal in the triple jump event.

## Melbourne 1956

The **Games of the XVI Olympiad** took place in a Southern Hemisphere country for the first time from November 22 to December 8, 1956. Three thousand, three hundred and 76 athletes (2,938 men and 376 women) from 72 countries participated.

The equestrian trials were held six months earlier in Stockholm, Sweden, between June 11 and 17 due to Australian quarantine laws. Thus, the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games were the first (and to date only) with events on different continents. 

The Melbourne Olympic Games were marked by boycotts months before the opening because of political conflicts such as the [Suez war](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/suez) and the repression of the Hungarian revolution. However, at the closing ceremony, around 500 athletes marched together in a single group under the Olympic flag. For this reason, they were nicknamed the *friendship games*.

The **Soviet Union** was the country that won the most medals, a total of 98, and for the first time surpassed the **United States**, which won 74 medals. The locals were in third place in the medal table. **Australia** tripled the number of medals won in 1952 and achieved their best performance until Atlanta 1996.

## Rome 1960

The **1960 Rome Olympic Games** were held on Italian soil for the first time. 5,338 athletes (4,727 men and 611 women) from 83 countries participated in the sporting event. These were the first Olympics to be broadcast live on television.

Soviet gymnast legend [Larisa Latynina](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/larisa-latynina) won three golds, two silvers, and a bronze, reaching a tally of 12 at the time. Latynina ended her career with 18 medals, the most decorated woman ever.

Another woman, American athlete [Wilma Rudolph](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/wilma-rudolph), a former polio sufferer, won three gold medals in track sprint competitions.

Rome 1960 brought the first black African Olympic Champion. Ethiopian [Abebe Bikila](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/abebe-bikila) won the men's marathon **barefoot**.

**South Africa** appeared in the Olympic arena for the last time under the [apartheid regime](https://www.britannica.com/topic/apartheid). They would not be allowed to return until 1992, after the abandonment of apartheid and during the transition to a black majority government.

A tragic event happened during the games. Danish cyclist [Knud Enemark Jensen](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/knud-enemark-jensen) collapsed during his race under the influence of amphetamines and later died in hospital.

## Tokyo 1964

The **1964 Tokyo Olympic** Games took place for the first time in Asia. Japan's capital hosted the event between October 10 and October 24. 

Tokyo 1964 was the first Olympics broadcast via satellite.

A total of 5,151 athletes (4,473 men and 678 women) from 93 national committees competed in 163 events. Fifteen countries made their debut. Judo, volleyball, and the women's modern pentathlon also debuted. South Africa, Indonesia, and North Korea were excluded from the Games for different reasons.

The United States led the medal tally with 90 medals (36 golds), followed by the Soviet Union. **Abebe Bikila** repeated his marathon victory conquered four years before in Rome. American swimmer [Donald Schollander](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/donald-arthur-schollander) earned four golds. **Larisa Latýnina** cemented her legend status with six medals (gathering 18 in her Olympic career).

## Mexico City 1968

A total of 5,516 athletes (4,735 men and 781 women) from 112 countries participated. It was the first time that Germany competed as separate countries for the first time.

This was the first edition of the event organized by:

 - A developing country.
 - A Spanish-speaking nation.

Also, these were the first games:

 - Held in Latin America.
 - With anti-doping controls and gender testing.

**Seventy-six Olympic and thirty world records were broken** at these Olympic Games. The United States was the most successful contingent, winning 107 medals. Gymnasts [Věra Čáslavská (Czechoslovakia)](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/vera-caslavska) and [Mikhail Voronin (Soviet Union)](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/mikhail-voronin) were the most decorated athletes.

## Munich 1972

The **Games of the XX Olympiad** was an international multi-sport event held in Munich, Federal Germany, between August 26 and September 11, 1972, with 7,134 athletes from 121 countries participating.

It was the first time that women had a representation of over 1,000 athletes (1,059). Waldi, a dachshund dog, became the first Olympic mascot ever.

Unfortunately, the 1972 Olympic Games are remembered because of an [act of terrorism](https://www.britannica.com/event/Munich-1972-Olympic-Games). Despite this, the Games continued after being suspended for only twenty-four hours. However, some athletes left the Munich Olympic Village.

In the sports field, American swimmer [Mark Spitz](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/mark-spitz) won 7 gold medals in swimming, while Finnish [Lasse Virén](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/lasse-viren) won a double in 5,000 and 10,000 meters. The USSR beat the United States in the men's basketball final (51-50) with a last-second basket.
