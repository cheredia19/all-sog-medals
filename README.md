## Athens 1896

The **Olympic Games of Athens 1896**, considered the first ones of the Contemporary Age, were held in Athens, Greece, between April 6 and 15, 1896. Two hundred and forty-one male athletes from 14 countries competed (there was no female participation) in nine sports.

The most successful competitor was the German wrestler and gymnast [Carl Schuhmann](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/carl-schumann), who won four gold medals, two of them individually.

Since then, athletes from all over the world meet every four years to compete against each other. Due to the First and Second World Wars, no games were held in 1916, 1940, 1944, and 1948.

## Paris 1900

The **Paris 1900 Olympic Games** took place from May 14 to October 28, 1900, within the framework of the Universal Exposition. 

As a consequence, there was no opening or closing ceremony, the events took place over five months, and these events were not called "Olympic Games" in official documents or on promotional posters, so many athletes would be unaware, some until their deaths, that they had competed in the Olympic Games.

According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), 997 athletes from 24 countries, **including 22 women**, competed. [Charlotte Cooper](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/charlotte-cooper), a British tennis player, was the first female Olympic champion in an individual competition. 

With his victories in the 60-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, 200-meter hurdles, and long jump, the American athlete [Alvin Kraenzlein](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/alvin-kraenzlein) was the main winner of the event.

After Tokyo 2020, Kraenzlein remains the only athlete to have won **four individual track and field gold medals at the same Olympic Games**. 

The hosts dominated the medal tally with 101 medals (26 gold) ahead of the United States (47, 19) and Great Britain (30, 15).

## St. Louis 1904

The **1904 St. Louis Olympic Games** were held between July 1 and November 23, 1904. Six hundred and fifty-one athletes (only six women) from 12 countries participated, competing in 16 Olympic sports.

These games were part of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. The organizers spread the sporting events over more than four months, just like in the previous edition.

Only 42 athletes from other countries participated because the organizers barely managed to interest athletes from Europe in crossing the Atlantic to participate in the event, allowing the United States to almost exclusively dominate the medal table.

For the first time, Olympic sports included freestyle wrestling and boxing.

## London 1908

The **London 1908 Olympic Games** took place from April 27 to October 31, 1908. With a total duration of **187 days**, these were the longest in the history of the modern Olympic Games.

2,008 athletes (1,971 men and 37 women) from 22 countries participated, competing in 24 sports and 105 events.

Competitors from 19 countries earned medals, with Great Britain leading the medal table, followed by the United States and Sweden.

## Stockholm 1912

The **1912 Stockholm Olympic Games** were held between May 5 and July 27, 1912. It was attended by 2,407 athletes (2,359 men and 48 women) from 28 countries.

This edition was the first to feature events such as **decathlon** and **pentathlon**, both won by the American athlete [Jim Thorpe](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/jim-thorpe), **women's diving**, and **women's swimming**.

The medals were mostly shared between the Swedish and U.S. delegations, with the former prevailing in the overall medal count with 65 total medals, while the latter was the most successful in gold medals, with 25.

## Antwerp 1920

After not celebrating the Olympics in 1916 due to World War I, the sixth edition of the modern Olympics finally took place from April 20 to September 12, 1920, in Antwerp, Belgium.

Despite the great Central Empires (German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria) not being invited to the Games, participation reached a then-record high of 29 countries and 2,626 athletes. 

Twenty-two disciplines were competed in, with 152 events. Brazil, Estonia, Monaco, New Zealand, and former countries Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia made their debut at the Olympic Games.

As in the 1912 Stockholm Games, the countries that won the most medals were the United States, Sweden, and Great Britain. But Belgium was third overall thanks to its 16 gold medals.

American shooter [Willis Lee](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/willis-lee) was the most successful athlete with seven medals, five of them gold, while Italian fencer [Nedo Nadi](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/nedo-nadi) won all five events in which he performed.

## Paris 1924

The **1924 Paris Olympic Games**, officially known as the *Games of the VIII Olympiad*, were held in Paris, France, for the second time. The games took place between May 4 and July 27. The venue hosted 3,089 athletes (2,956 men and 136 women) from 44 countries.

The Olympic program of this edition comprised 22 sports disciplines, with 123 events.

Austrian-American swimmer [Johnny Weissmüller](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/johnny-weissmuller), famous for his role as Tarzan, won four medals (three gold and a bronze) in swimming and water polo. Finnish [Paavo Nurmi](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/paavo-nurmi) won the 1500m and 5000m races, held within an hour of each other, and the cross-country, held in extremely high temperatures.

## Amsterdam 1928

The **Amsterdam 1928 Olympic Games** were held between May 17 and August 12 of that year. A total of 2,883 athletes (2,606 men and 277 women) from 46 countries participated, competing in 19 disciplines and 104 specialties.

Finland's **Paavo Nurmi** won three more gold medals in the long-distance and middle-distance events to finish his brilliant career with nine gold medals. For his part, **Johnny Weissmüller** once again won the 100-meter sprint freestyle swimming event and finished with five gold medals in swimming and a bronze in water polo.

Athletes from 28 nations won a gold medal, a record that was not broken until 40 years later.

## Los Angeles 1932

The Olympic Games returned to the United States after remaining in Europe for 28 years, but the trip to the far west coast and the fact that the [Great Depression](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression) was still plaguing the world, led to a reduction in the number of participating countries and athletes, especially from Europe.

Thus, the number of nations participating dropped from 46 to 37. Consequently, the number of athletes dropped 55.9%, from 3,014 to 1,328 (1,206 men and 126 women).

Japanese 14 years and 309 days old swimmer [Kusuo Kitamura](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/kusuo-kitamura) won in the 1500 m freestyle swimming and became the youngest athlete to win a gold medal. Kitamura kept the record for 58 years, until Hungarian swimmer Krisztina Egerszegi broke it.

American [Mildred Didrikson](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/mildred-didrikson), considered by many authorities *the greatest all-round sportswoman in history*, won the gold medal in the javelin and set world records in the high jump and 80 meters.
